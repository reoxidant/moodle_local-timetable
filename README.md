# moodle_local-timetable
The Moodle module for teachers which show time and date of lecture

In the teacher's personal account (under "Personal files") you need to display the "Lesson schedule" for this teacher similar to the studentâ€™s on the basis of the document "Teacher Development by Day".
 There are two options for viewing the schedule for implementation:
 1. A form similar to that of a student, columns from left to right:
 - Class time
 - Groups (identical lines collapse by study group)
 - Discipline
 - The audience
 - Type of activity
 - Teacher (may be several, plus substitute)
 - Department
 2. An alternative form of viewing (a button for switching) is a calendar with first showing the schedule, and then protecting the term papers and the time of practical training.
